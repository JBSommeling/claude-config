# claude-code-model-routing

A global `CLAUDE.md` configuration that routes tasks to the right Claude model automatically — Opus for reasoning, Sonnet for implementation, Haiku for I/O. Includes subagent definitions, skills, and custom slash commands.

## Why

Claude Code defaults to one model for everything. That means you're either paying Opus prices for reading files, or using Haiku for architecture decisions. Neither is optimal.

This configuration turns Claude Code into a self-routing system:

- **Opus** acts as a senior engineer — planning, debugging, reviewing
- **Sonnet** handles implementation — writing code, fixing tests, refactoring
- **Haiku** does the grunt work — reading files, generating boilerplate, searching

Each subagent runs in its own context window, so heavy I/O work never pollutes your main session. This stretches your weekly usage limit significantly.

CLAUDE.md                  # Global routing rules and skill registry
.claudeignore              # Universal ignore file for any project
install.sh                 # One-command installer
```

## Setup

### 1. Clone and install globally

```bash
git clone https://github.com/JBSommeling/claude-config
cd claude-config
chmod +x install.sh && ./install.sh
```

This copies everything to your global Claude directory and applies routing rules, agents, skills, and commands to every project automatically.

### 2. Add project-specific context (per repo) — optional

The global CLAUDE.md handles routing. Each project only needs a minimal file with codebase-specific context.

```bash
mkdir -p .claude
touch .claude/CLAUDE.md
```

Example project CLAUDE.md:

```markdown
## Project context
- Laravel 11, PHP 8.3
- Tests use Pest
- Main models in /app/Models
```

No need to repeat routing rules — they are inherited from the global file.

### 3. Copy .claudeignore per project

```bash
cp .claudeignore /your/project/.claudeignore
```

### 4. Start Claude Code on Opus

```bash
claude --model claude-opus-4-7
```

Verify setup with `/status` inside Claude Code. You should see both CLAUDE.md files listed and all agents, skills, and commands available.

                               - Planning
```

## Development pipeline

`/full-pipeline` orchestrates the complete workflow:

```
/spec → /plan → /build (loop) → /validate → /review → /ship
```

Checkpoints after spec and plan for approval. Build, validate, review, and ship run automatically. Individual commands work standalone too.

## Key rules

**File reading** — Opus never reads large files directly. It delegates to Haiku, and only passes the relevant subset — specific functions, line ranges, or interface definitions — never full files when a subset is sufficient.

**Boilerplate** — Tests, config files, fixtures, and repetitive patterns go to Haiku. Opus reviews the output.

**Documentation** — Never written directly. Haiku handles it with conversation context, Opus approves.

**Code review** — After every Sonnet implementation, Opus reviews before the task is considered done.

**Git safety** — All git write operations (commit, push, branch creation, merge, rebase, reset, tag, PR creation) require explicit user approval. Read-only git operations run freely.

## Included agents

| Agent | Model | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `reader` | Haiku | File reading, codebase search, summarization |
| `implementer` | Sonnet | Writing code, fixing tests, refactoring |
| `code-reviewer` | Opus | Code review dispatch — used by /review-pr, /ship, and /review |
| `security-auditor` | Opus | Security review dispatch |
| `test-engineer` | Sonnet | Test writing and coverage dispatch |

## Skills and commands

Skills and commands are auto-discovered from `~/.claude/skills/` and `~/.claude/commands/`. Check those directories for the full list of installed items.

Key workflows:

- **Spec-first development** — `/spec` → `/plan` → `/build` → `/validate` → `/review` → `/ship`, or run `/full-pipeline` to orchestrate the whole sequence
- **Test-driven development** — `/test` activates red-green-refactor for the session
- **Debugging** — `/diagnose` for disciplined debugging when the cause is unknown
- **Code quality** — `/review`, `/review-pr` (posts inline comments on GitHub), `/code-simplify`, and the `code-review` skill
- **Security** — `/review` with the `security-and-hardening` skill and security-auditor agent

## Bonus: .claudeignore

A universal `.claudeignore` is included. Copy it into any project to prevent Claude from reading files that waste tokens or should never be read — dependencies, build output, lock files, logs, secrets, and binaries.

```bash
cp .claudeignore /your/project/.claudeignore
```

Highlights:
- `node_modules/` and `vendor/` — prevents accidental dependency reads
- `package-lock.json`, `yarn.lock`, `composer.lock`, `go.sum` — lock files are huge and useless for Claude
- `.env` and `*.key` — keeps secrets out of Claude's context
- `storage/logs/` and `*.log` — log files are rarely what you want Claude reading

## Compatibility

Works with any tech stack. The routing is based on task type, not language or framework. Tested with Laravel and Go projects but applies universally.
